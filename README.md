# TinyMCE Demos
TinyMCE is a versatile tool that can be used for a wide variety of text editing tasks. This repository aims to inspire you and demonstrate different approaches to common use cases.

Every demo has a thorougly documented HTML file explaining the TinyMCE config as well as links to relevant documentation to make it easy to use these demos as basis for your own projects.
