<!--
    Normally we strongly advice against overriding the TinyMCE CSS
    to tweak the editor. The proper way to change the visual
    appearance is to make a skin. That said, there is always
    exceptions to a good rule and moving a couple of toolbar buttons
    to the right side of the toolbar is one example of such an
    exception.

    Since the toolbar is using flexbox it's pretty easy to just add
    one simple CSS override to move a toolbar button group over to
    the other side. However, there are some caveats:

    * It is not supported
    * It probably has issues with right-to-left languages
    * Future updates to TinyMCE might change the UI HTML and CSS,
      thus breaking the UI

    But if you know what you are doing and accept the consequences,
    this is how you move buttons! See the Style tag below for
    instructions.
